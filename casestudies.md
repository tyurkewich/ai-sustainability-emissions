# Case Studies & Examples of AI for Good 

Like any tool, how we use AI will play a major role in its impact on sustainability. Below are industry examples where AI is being used for good, to help people and the planet. 

**Tracking tree health to give actionable advice**: [Link](https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/gardens/2025/avanade-intelligent-garden).
- A first-ever intelligent garden was showcased at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show and even won a gold medal. The garden used sensors to track tree health conditions such as growth, water, and soil - and paired this with AI to spot trends and provide actionable advice for tree care. Using a web-based app, visotrs could speak to the trees via genai and learn what care the trees needed or how they were handling weather conditions. Alerts could also be sent out if issues were predicted for the trees such as under-watering. This pilot project served as a great testing ground for research on trees and to further support biodiversity. 

**Scaling conservation efforts by tracking and understanding animal patterns**: [Link](https://www.psu.edu/news/research/story/male-giraffes-are-more-socially-connected-females).  
- In a groundbreaking study led by researchers from Penn State and Microsoft’s AI for Good Research Lab, artificial intelligence was used to analyze the social networks of over 1,000 endangered Masai giraffes in Tanzania, revealing that male giraffes are more socially connected than females. By applying AI-driven social network analysis to five years of observational data, the team uncovered complex multilevel social structures, with males forming broader but weaker social ties and females maintaining fewer but stronger bonds. This AI-powered insight into giraffe social behavior not only deepens our understanding of their ecology but also supports sustainability efforts by informing more effective conservation strategies tailored to the species’ social dynamics. 

**Collecting and processing data in remote areas using solar energy, satellites, and the cloud**: [Link](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2024/12/18/announcing-sparrow-a-breakthrough-ai-tool-to-measure-and-protect-earths-biodiversity-in-the-most-remote-places/). 
- SPARROW (Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch), is an innovative AI-powered tool designed to monitor and protect biodiversity in the planet’s most remote regions. SPARROW uses solar energy and edge computing to autonomously collect and process environmental data—such as images and sounds from camera traps and acoustic sensors—using advanced PyTorch-based AI models. This data is then transmitted via low-Earth orbit satellites to the cloud, enabling researchers to access real-time insights into ecosystem health without disturbing natural habitats. By providing scalable, low-impact, and continuous biodiversity monitoring, SPARROW empowers conservationists with the data needed to make informed decisions, supporting global sustainability and species preservation efforts.

**Protecting culture and making education accessible through digital twins**: [Link](https://unlocked.microsoft.com/vatican/). 
- AI is being used to create an ultra-precise 3D digital twin of St. Peter’s Basilica, one of the world’s most iconic cultural landmarks. Using advanced photogrammetry and AI, over 400,000 high-resolution images were processed to digitally reconstruct the Basilica in intricate detail. This AI-powered model enables global access to the site through immersive exhibits and an interactive website, allowing people to explore and learn about its rich history without physical travel. By digitally preserving cultural heritage in this way, the project supports sustainability by reducing the environmental impact of tourism while ensuring that future generations can experience and study these irreplaceable sites.

**Mapping renewable energy to scale capacity**: [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/global-renewables-watch-ai-for-good-lab-geospatial/) and [Github](https://github.com/microsoft/solar-farms-mapping).
- The project uses AI and satellite imagery to map and monitor solar and wind energy installations worldwide. By applying deep learning models to over 13 trillion pixels of satellite data, the tool identifies renewable energy infrastructure, estimates their construction dates, and tracks land use changes over time. This AI-powered platform provides real-time, high-resolution insights into the global expansion of renewable energy, enabling policymakers and researchers to assess progress toward sustainability goals and make data-driven decisions to accelerate the transition to clean energy.

**Creating conservation models with AI**: [Github](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps). 
- Leveraging AI to support global biodiversity and sustainability efforts by enabling automated wildlife monitoring through camera trap imagery. At its core is PyTorch-Wildlife, a collaborative deep learning framework that includes models like MegaDetector, DeepFaune, and HerdNet for detecting and classifying animals in images. These AI models help conservationists process vast amounts of ecological data efficiently, reducing the need for manual image review and enabling faster, data-driven decisions in wildlife protection. 

**Spotting changes in ecosystems to manage deforestation**: [Link](https://unlocked.microsoft.com/collections/the-intersection/) 
- Deforestation is threatening the survival of millions of species that make their home in the Amazon rainforest. Project Guacamaya is fighting to preserve the rainforest with AI by looking at daily pictures of Earth taken with satellites, observing animal behavior from within the rainforest with hidden cameras, and listening to forest sounds with tiny microphones. AI helps spot changes to monitor deforestation while identifying images and sounds, allowing scientists to protect biodiversity faster than ever before. Empowered by the AI for Good Lab, the future of the Amazon is changing for the better.

**Mapping populations to improve resilience in cities**: [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/the-prompt-with-trevor-noah-episode-1-ihme-population-mapping/) and [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/the-prompt-with-trevor-noah-episode-2-how-is-ai-protecting-vulnerable-communities/).
- Using AI and satellite imagery to map underserved and often overlooked populations around the world. By identifying where people live and how they are affected by climate change, food insecurity, and health disparities, this AI-driven initiative supports sustainability by enabling more equitable and efficient distribution of resources and services in vulnerable regions
