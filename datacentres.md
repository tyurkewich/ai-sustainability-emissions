**PUE for specific datacenter or region**

Power Usage Effectiveness, or PUE, is an industry metric that measures the energy efficiency of a datacenter. It considers things like powering, cooling, and operating the servers, data networks, and lights. PUE is measured by dividing the total energy needed for a datacenter facility, by the total energy used for computing. The closer the PUE number is to “1”, the more efficient the datacenter. In Azure Microsoft groups multiple datacentersinto a region and there is no way for a customer to pick a specific datacentre building. Also, each region which (even within Availability Zones) can have a mix of different generations of datacentres.

While there is no publicly disclosed, region-specific PUE for Azure regions, Microsoft’s datacentres globally operate within a **PUE range of 1.05 to 1.20**. This range reflects the efficiency of Microsoft’s Generation 4 and 5 datacentre designs.

The links below talk a bit more about it and show a few different examples:

As the PUE measurement varies, it's best to look at the organisation's overall emissions in the **Emissions Impact Dashboards** for **M365 and Azure** and/or **Azure Carbon Optimisation**. These dashboards take into account many factors to provide a more accurate way to determine the emissions of your applications and servers.
